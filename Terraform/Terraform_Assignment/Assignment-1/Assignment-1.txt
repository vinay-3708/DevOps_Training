Create a file called main.tf.
Create a docker image resource and call it nginx_image.

Initializing the backend...

Initializing provider plugins...
- Reusing previous version of kreuzwerker/docker from the dependency lock file
- Using previously-installed kreuzwerker/docker v2.15.0

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.

C:\Users\nanda\Desktop\New_folder\Terraform\Terraform\Assignment-1>terraform plan -out tf_image_plan.tfplan

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:   
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # docker_image.nginx_image will be created
  + resource "docker_image" "nginx_image" {
      + id          = (known after apply)
      + latest      = (known after apply)
      + name        = "nginx:latest"
      + output      = (known after apply)
      + repo_digest = (known after apply)
    }

Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── 

Saved the plan to: tf_image_plan.tfplan

To perform exactly these actions, run the following command to apply:
    terraform apply "tf_image_plan.tfplan"

C:\Users\nanda\Desktop\New_folder\Terraform\Terraform\Assignment-1>terraform apply "tf_image_plan.tfplan"
