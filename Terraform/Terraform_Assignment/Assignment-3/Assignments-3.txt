Adding Maps and Lookups in your Terraform files
The lab files can be found @ https://github.com/satyensingh/terraform-assignment-resources.git
In the repo you will find main.tf, outputs.tf, and variables.tf.
Add a new variable called env. Set a description to “env: dev or prod”.
Convert the type from image_name to map.

Change the default to use key/value pairs. Set dev to ghost:latest and prod to ghost:alpine.

Convert container_name to a map. Change the default to use key/value pairs. Set dev to blog_dev and prod to blog_prod.

Convert ext_port to a map. Change the default to use key/value pairs. Set dev to 8080 and prod to 80.

Now initialize Terraform.

Setup the Development environment
Create a workspace called dev.
Generate a Terraform plan. Output the plan and call it tfdev_plan. Pass in a variable called env and set it to dev.
Apply tfdev_plan.

Setup the Production environment
Create a workspace called prod.
Generate a Terraform plan. Output the plan and call it tfprod_plan. Pass in a variable called env and set it to prod.
Apply tfprod_plan.

Verify both environments work
Open a browser and navigate to the public IP. This should pull up the production environment.
Open a browser tab and navigate to the public IP on port 8080. This should pull up the development environment.
